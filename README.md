## Description

The objective for this project was to refactor existing HTML code using semantic elements and restructuring the corresponding CSS stylesheet. This allows for the website to have meaning beyond its basic structural layout and provides for a more accessible user experience. This also enhances the browser's ability to read the contents of the webpage and, thus, allows them to better deliver based on user queries. 

Key reasons for making a website accessible:
- Assistant technologies (like screen readers for the blind or video captions for the deaf) are better able to communicate the website functionality to a user with a disability.
- SEO rankings are also impacted by the accessiblity of a website.


## Features

- Visual appearance of website has not changed due to the refactoring project.
- HTML is now written in a semantic language to improve accessibility.
- Bug Fix: List item in header navigation bar was not linked to corresponding article. This has been remedied.


## Lessons Learned
Throughout this challenge, I have learned the meaning of semantic code, the purpose for website accessibility, and how to improve upon existing code while not compromising the integrity of the website. This process required strategic use of Google, Bootcamp office hours, tutoring resources, and good old-fashioned trial-and-error in order to achieve the appropriate end result.
